# My Portfolio Site
A simple portfolio website using Blazor WebAssembly.

# Plans
For the moment, this is just a simplistic landing page, showing off some of my skills, and links for where you can reach me (Discord, email, etc.). Eventually, I plan on having a list of notable projects powered by a REST API, and some more interactivity.

# Deployment
I'm currently deploying this manually, it's too simplistic for something like Docker ot Kubernetes. Once there is more stuff to show off, I'll sort out a proper DevOps cycle.
